# ColorSheets (legacy)

This is repo contains very early attempts to take what I could do with MatLab, Java and C++ and reimplement it for the web. The work is experimental at best, but oddly enough, it still works!

> **Note**: I got it to work by serving it locally, still figuring out github pages setup for this to work.

You can check out the [demo](./demo)
