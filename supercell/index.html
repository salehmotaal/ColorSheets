                    <section title="Screening">
                        <h5>Need for Screening</h5>

                        <p>For Offset or Flexo printing, it is only possible to either print full color, or no color. It is not possible to print fractional ink film thicknesses. Such a system is called a 1 bit graylevel system. For such a system to be able to print tone values other than solid or nothing, screening is required. AM screening uses halftone cells that contain halftone dots. By changing dot size relative to the halftone cell, the different tone values can be generated (dot area). To be functional, it is important that the halftone dots are so small, that they are not resolved by the eye and therefore are perceived as continuous tone rather as separate dots.</p>

                        <p>With AM screening, for a system with a bitdepth of 1, the number of tone values that can be reproduced is given by the number of spots per halftone cell. Therefore, in order to be able to reproduce sufficient tone values, high addressability systems are needed. Often systems are designed to have 256 gray levels, which means that for these systems there have to be 256 spots per halftone cell, or 16x16 spots. The reason CtP systems often use an addressability of 2400 spots per inch (spi) is because, for a screen ruling of 150 lpi, a halftone cell has 16x16 spots. The general equation that can be used to calculate the number of gray levels is:</p>

                        <p>Number of gray levels = (Addressability / screen ruling)2 +1 or (spi / lpi)2 +1<br>
                        One level is added because no spots at all (white paper) is also a gray level.</p>

                    <section title="Single-Cell">
                        <h5>Singlecell Sreening</h5>

                        <p>Halftone cells must mesh with one another seamlessly. The only way this is possible is by making the 4 corners of a halftone cell go exactly to the intersections of the addressability grid. Therefore, when we request a certain screen ruling and screen angle, the Raster Image Processor (RIP) of the output device may not produce exactly the requested values, instead, it must round the halftone cell size so that it’s corners fall exactly on the addressability grid intersections. The increments by which screen rulings or screen angles are possible depend on the halftone cell size. The larger the halftone cell the more accurate the screening parameters and the more gray levels, but also the coarser the screening.</p>

                        <p>If there are not enough gray levels available, gradients in images (sky, skin tone) may be shown with steps. There are ways to reduce the visibility of stepping or posterizing: 1.) use a larger graylevel-cell and 2.) add a small amount of tonal noise to the picture. (The graylevel-cell does not necessarily have to be the same size as a halftone cell.)</p>

                        <p>With single cell screening, the errors in screen angles and screen ruling are so large that for color work, moirés between the 4 colors are likely to occur. Therefore something else is needed in practice.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section title="Super-Cell">
                        <h5>Supercell Screening</h5>

                        <p>There are many ways the spots can be arranged within a halftone cell. Center clustered spots produce single cell AM halftones, randomly placed spots produce FM or Stochastic halftones, however it is also possible to place more than one AM dot in a halftone cell, and this results in a Supercell. The advantage of a supercell is that, because it is larger than a single cell, it can produce more accurate screen rulings and screen angels, and, if the gray level cell is also larger, more gray levels can be produced.</p>

                        <p>The cells for the separate dots within a supercell no longer have to have the four corners aligned with the addressability grid, only the supercell is aligned. This means that the separate dots within the supercell are not necessarily identical to one another, but on average over the supercell, they cover an area that produces the correct tone value.</p>

                        <p>Super cell technology is a very elegant solution to the problems of AM halftoning of 1 bit systems.</p>

                    <section title="Bit-Depth">
                        <h5>Systems with a bit depth of more than 1</h5>

                        <p>Systems that are unable to achieve high addressability, such as electrostatic printing, need another method to generate tone values. Fortunately, they are able to image each spot at more than one gray level and therefore also achieve high quality printing. Such systems are said to have a bitdepth of more than one. Bitdepth is measured as the number of possible gray levels of each spot, expressed as the power of 2 (256 gray levels = 28 levels = a bit depth of 8)</p>
